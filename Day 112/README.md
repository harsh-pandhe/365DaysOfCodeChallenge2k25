# 🎯 Day #112 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I built a **simple HTML contact form** to practice fundamental web development skills and improve user interaction design. Forms are the backbone of many web applications, and creating a clean, accessible contact page is a great way to reinforce semantic HTML and basic styling techniques.

---

## 📚 What I Did Today

* ✅ Structured the page with semantic **HTML5** elements  
* ✅ Styled the layout using **CSS** for centering, spacing, and responsive design  
* ✅ Added form controls: **text**, **email**, and **textarea** inputs with validation  
* ✅ Applied hover effects and mobile-friendly styling  

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

* ✅ Semantic HTML enhances accessibility and SEO  
* ✅ Flexbox and centering techniques simplify layout alignment  
* ✅ Form validation attributes enforce basic input checks  
* ✅ Inline CSS can quickly prototype designs before external stylesheet setup  

---

## 🚀 Your Turn!

Try extending this challenge by:

* 🧩 Integrating **JavaScript** to handle form submissions and show success/error messages  
* ➕ Adding **external CSS** file and organizing styles into reusable classes  
* ⚙️ Implementing **server-side** form handling with Node.js or PHP for real submissions
