# 🎯 Day #133 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I created a **product card with advanced hover effects using CSS**! This project was excellent for learning modern CSS animation techniques, 3D transforms, and interactive design patterns. Building an engaging product card taught me about micro-interactions, visual feedback, and creating compelling user experiences that drive engagement and conversions.

The combination of smooth animations, 3D effects, and interactive elements creates a truly modern e-commerce component!
