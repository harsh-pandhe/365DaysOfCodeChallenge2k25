## 🎯 Day #32 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge!

### 💭 **A Personal Reflection:**  
Merging ideas, perspectives, or even two playlists can be fun—just like finding common elements in two arrays! Today, I tackled the **intersection of two arrays**, a problem that highlights the importance of data structures and efficiency in searching.  

---

### 📚 **What I Did Today:**  
I implemented a Python program to find the **intersection** (common elements) of two arrays.  

---

### 🛠️ **Code:**  

```python
# intersection_arrays.py
def find_intersection(arr1, arr2):
    return list(set(arr1) & set(arr2))

array1 = list(map(int, input("Enter the first array elements separated by spaces: ").split()))
array2 = list(map(int, input("Enter the second array elements separated by spaces: ").split()))

intersection = find_intersection(array1, array2)
print(f"Intersection of the two arrays: {intersection}")
```

---

### 💡 **Key Learning:**  
- **Using Sets**: The `&` operator on sets makes intersection operations fast and concise.  
- **Handling Duplicates**: The set approach automatically removes duplicates, but if order matters, a different method (like two-pointer or hashmap) is needed.  

---

### ✨ **Extra Touch:**  
1. **Preserving Order & Handling Duplicates:**  
For cases where order matters and duplicates should be retained, I also wrote a **two-pointer** approach for sorted arrays:  

```python
def intersection_sorted(arr1, arr2):
    i, j = 0, 0
    result = []
    
    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] == arr2[j]:
            result.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
            j += 1
        elif arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    
    return result
```

2. **Edge Cases Considered:**  
   - One or both arrays being empty.  
   - No common elements.  
   - Arrays with all elements in common.  

---

### 🚀 **Your Turn:**  
Can you modify this to find the **union** of two arrays or implement an approach without using extra space?
