# 🎯 Day #120 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I built a **complete landing page for a fictional product called FlowTracker**! This project was fantastic for combining all my frontend skills - HTML structure, CSS styling, responsive design, and JavaScript interactivity. Creating a full landing page taught me about user experience design, conversion optimization, and how to present a product effectively.

It's incredible how a well-designed landing page can tell a complete story and guide users toward taking action!
