# 🎯 Day #129 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I implemented a **sticky header using CSS** with modern design enhancements! This project was excellent for learning about CSS positioning, scroll effects, and responsive navigation design. Building a sticky header taught me about backdrop filters, smooth transitions, and creating navigation experiences that enhance rather than obstruct content consumption.

The combination of fixed positioning, scroll detection, and responsive design creates a truly professional navigation experience!
