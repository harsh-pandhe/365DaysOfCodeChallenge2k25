# 🎯 Day #124 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I built a **digital clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**! This project was fantastic for exploring real-time updates, multiple time zones, and theme customization. Creating a feature-rich digital clock taught me about the Intl API, time zone handling, and how to build interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing.

The combination of precise time display, multiple themes, and international time zones creates a truly professional clock application!
