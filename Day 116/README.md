# 🎯 Day #116 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I built a **to-do list application with local storage functionality**! This project was incredible for understanding how to persist data in web applications without needing a backend server. The combination of DOM manipulation, array operations, and localStorage API created a fully functional task management system that remembers your tasks even after closing the browser.

It's fascinating how localStorage bridges the gap between temporary and permanent data storage in client-side applications!

## 📚 What I Did Today

* ✅ Created a responsive to-do list interface with input field and task display  
* ✅ Implemented localStorage to persist tasks across browser sessions  
* ✅ Built add and delete functionality with dynamic DOM updates  
* ✅ Used JSON methods to serialize and deserialize task arrays

## 💡 Key Learnings

* ✅ localStorage provides persistent client-side data storage using key-value pairs  
* ✅ JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() handle object serialization for storage  
* ✅ Event listeners and DOM manipulation create dynamic, interactive interfaces  
* ✅ Array methods like filter() enable efficient data manipulation for CRUD operations

## 🚀 Your Turn!

Try extending this to-do app with:

* 🧩 Adding task completion status with checkboxes and strikethrough styling  
* ➕ Implementing task categories, priorities, or due dates  
* ⚙️ Creating edit functionality and drag-and-drop reordering for tasks
