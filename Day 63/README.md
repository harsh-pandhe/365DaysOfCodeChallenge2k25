# 🎯 Day #63 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge!  

## 💭 Personal Reflection  
When I first learned about Fibonacci numbers, I was amazed at how they appeared everywhere—**nature, music, art, and even algorithms**! But computing them efficiently? That’s where **Dynamic Programming** shines! 🚀  

## 📚 What I Did Today  
I implemented an **optimized** approach to find the **nth Fibonacci number** using **Dynamic Programming (DP)** instead of the slow recursive method.

### 📝 **Fibonacci Using Dynamic Programming**  

```python
# fibonacci_dp.py

def fibonacci(n):
    """Finds the nth Fibonacci number using Dynamic Programming"""
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

    fib = [0] * (n + 1)
    fib[1] = 1

    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]

    return fib[n]

n = 10
print(f"Fibonacci({n}):", fibonacci(n))
```

## 💡 Key Learning  
✅ **Why Use DP Instead of Recursion?**  
- **Recursive Fibonacci** has **O(2ⁿ) time complexity** 🤯 (very slow!).  
- **DP Approach** runs in **O(n) time** with **O(n) space**, avoiding redundant calculations.  
- We could **further optimize** it to **O(n) time & O(1) space** using two variables instead of an array.  

---

## ✅ **Optimized Approach (O(1) Space)**  
```python
def fibonacci_optimized(n):
    """Optimized Fibonacci using only two variables (O(1) space)"""
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1

    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b

    return b
```
