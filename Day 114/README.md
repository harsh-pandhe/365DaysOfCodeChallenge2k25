# 🎯 Day #114 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I built a **responsive navigation bar** using CSS and JavaScript! Navigation bars are one of the most important elements for user experience on any website, and responsiveness is key to ensuring it works on both desktop and mobile devices. By using media queries and a simple toggle function, I created a navbar that gracefully adapts to smaller screen sizes, showing a hamburger menu icon to toggle navigation links on mobile.

## 📚 What I Did Today

* ✅ Created a navigation bar with links styled for desktop  
* ✅ Added hover effects and active link styling  
* ✅ Used CSS media queries to hide links on small screens except the first and the menu icon  
* ✅ Wrote a JavaScript function to toggle the menu's visibility on mobile screens

## 💡 Key Learnings

* ✅ Responsive design improves usability across devices  
* ✅ CSS float can position elements but media queries control their visibility dynamically  
* ✅ Simple JavaScript toggles enhance interactivity for smaller screens  
* ✅ Accessibility considerations include ensuring navigation links are easy to use on mobile
