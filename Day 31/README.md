## 🎯 Day #31 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge!

### 💭 **A Personal Reflection:**  
Rotation isn’t just for dance moves—it’s a common challenge in programming too! Rotating an array by K positions taught me the importance of thinking outside the box and optimizing operations for performance.  

---

### 📚 **What I Did Today:**  
I implemented a Python program to rotate an array by **K positions**. This problem can be solved in multiple ways, but I went for an efficient approach using slicing.  

---

### 🛠️ **Code:**  

```python
# rotate_array.py
def rotate_array(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    k = k % n
    return arr[-k:] + arr[:-k]

array = list(map(int, input("Enter the array elements separated by spaces: ").split()))
k = int(input("Enter the number of positions to rotate: "))

rotated_array = rotate_array(array, k)
print(f"Array after rotating by {k} positions: {rotated_array}")
```

---

### 💡 **Key Learning:**  
This challenge highlighted the power of Python’s slicing capabilities for concise solutions. However, it also made me think about edge cases like when the array is empty or K is zero.  

---

### ✨ **Extra Touch:**  
1. **In-place Rotation:** I also explored an in-place solution using reversal:  

```python
def rotate_array_in_place(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    k = k % n
    arr[:] = arr[::-1]
    arr[:k] = arr[:k][::-1]
    arr[k:] = arr[k:][::-1]
    return arr
```

2. **Edge Cases:** Handled scenarios like:  
   - Empty arrays (`[]`).  
   - Negative K values (rotating left instead of right).  
   - K values larger than the array size.

### 🚀 **Your Turn:**  
Can you modify the program to rotate a **2D matrix** or work with strings instead of numbers?
