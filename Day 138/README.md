# 🎯 Day #138 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I created a **dynamic pie chart using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** with interactive features and animations! This project was excellent for learning data visualization concepts, CSS gradients, and creating engaging interactive dashboards. Building a pie chart from scratch taught me about mathematical calculations for data representation, user interface design for data controls, and creating smooth visual feedback systems.

The combination of conic gradients, interactive legends, and real-time data updates creates a truly professional data visualization tool!
