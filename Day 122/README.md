# 🎯 Day #122 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I built a **photo gallery with modal functionality**! This project was incredible for combining advanced CSS styling, JavaScript event handling, and user interface design. Creating a professional-looking gallery with smooth modal interactions taught me about modern web design patterns and how to create engaging visual experiences.

The combination of grid layouts, hover effects, and modal overlays creates a truly immersive photo viewing experience!
