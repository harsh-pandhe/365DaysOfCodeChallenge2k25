## ðŸ’­ **A Personal Reflection:**

Life is made up of small moments, just as numbers are made up of their digits. Today's challenge was all about breaking down a number into its parts and finding the sum. It's a reminder that even the smallest components contribute to the bigger picture.

---

## ðŸ“š **What I Did Today:**

I wrote a Python program to calculate the sum of the digits in a number. Whether itâ€™s for math puzzles or digital root calculations, this simple program has its charm.

---

### Code:

#### Iterative Approach:
```python
# sum_of_digits.py
def sum_of_digits(n):
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(f"The sum of the digits in {num} is: {sum_of_digits(num)}")
```

#### Handling Negative Numbers:
```python
# Modified for negative numbers
def sum_of_digits(n):
    n = abs(n)  # Handle negative numbers
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total
```

#### One-Liner Approach:
```python
# Using list comprehension
def sum_of_digits(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))
```

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Learning:**

This challenge reinforced the elegance of basic arithmetic. It also reminded me to handle edge cases, like negative numbers or zero. Exploring different approachesâ€”iterative, modular, and one-linersâ€”showed me how versatile Python can be.

---

## âœ¨ **Extra Touch:**

To add a creative spin, I explored the one-liner approach using `sum()` and `str()`. Itâ€™s amazing how concise and readable Python code can be while solving real-world problems.

---

## ðŸš€ **Your Turn:**

Try extending this to find the **digital root** of a number or sum the digits of multiple numbers in a list. What creative applications can you think of for this concept?
