# ðŸŽ¯ Day #2 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge 2k25!

---

## ðŸ’­ **A Personal Reflection:**

Today, I thought about how often we use calculators in our daily livesâ€”quick math is something we all take for granted. But what if we could create one ourselves? This was the challenge for Day 2, and I realized coding is like building tools to solve our own problems.

---

## ðŸ“š **What I Did Today:**

I created a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers. While itâ€™s a basic program, it reminded me of the beauty of logic in programming. Also, I took it a step further by handling edge cases like division by zero.

### Code:

```python
# calculator.py
def calculator():
    print("Welcome to the Python Calculator! ðŸ«®")
    num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    operation = input("Choose an operation (+, -, *, /): ")
    num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

    if operation == '+':
        print(f"Result: {num1} + {num2} = {num1 + num2}")
    elif operation == '-':
        print(f"Result: {num1} - {num2} = {num1 - num2}")
    elif operation == '*':
        print(f"Result: {num1} * {num2} = {num1 * num2}")
    elif operation == '/':
        if num2 != 0:
            print(f"Result: {num1} / {num2} = {num1 / num2}")
        else:
            print("Error: Division by zero is undefined!")
    else:
        print("Invalid operation. Please choose +, -, *, or /.")

calculator()
```

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Learning:**

Writing even the simplest of programs teaches you to think like a problem-solver. Itâ€™s not just about the final outputâ€”itâ€™s about thinking through every possibility and making your code robust.

---

## âœ¨ **Extra Touch:**

I added a little creativity to the user interface by making the calculator display its results in a fun, conversational style.

## ðŸš€ **Your Turn:**

If you were to design a calculator, what feature would you add to make it stand out? Drop your thoughts in the comments!
