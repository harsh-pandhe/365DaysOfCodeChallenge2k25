# 🎯 Day #128 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I created a **comprehensive form validation script using JavaScript**! This project was excellent for learning about client-side validation, regular expressions, and user experience design. Building a robust form validator taught me about input sanitization, error handling, and creating intuitive feedback systems that guide users through form completion.

The combination of real-time validation, visual feedback, and comprehensive error messages creates a truly professional form experience!
