# 🎯 Day #115 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I built a **JavaScript-based calculator** from scratch! This project was fantastic for practicing fundamental JavaScript concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, and string operations. Creating an interactive calculator reinforced how JavaScript brings static HTML to life, making web pages truly dynamic and user-friendly.

It's amazing how a few simple functions can create such a useful tool that we use every day!

## 📚 What I Did Today

* ✅ Created a clean calculator interface using HTML and CSS  
* ✅ Implemented JavaScript functions for display manipulation  
* ✅ Added event handlers for button clicks using onclick attributes  
* ✅ Built calculation logic with proper error handling using try-catch blocks  

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

* ✅ DOM manipulation with `getElementById()` allows dynamic content updates  
* ✅ The `eval()` function can execute mathematical expressions from strings  
* ✅ Error handling with try-catch prevents crashes from invalid inputs  
* ✅ Event-driven programming makes interfaces responsive and interactive

## 🚀 Your Turn!

Try extending this calculator with:

* 🧩 Adding decimal point functionality and advanced operations (square root, percentage)  
* ➕ Implementing keyboard support for number and operator input  
* ⚙️ Creating a history feature to store and recall previous calculations
