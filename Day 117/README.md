# 🎯 Day #117 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I built a **color picker tool** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This project was perfect for exploring the HTML5 color input type and understanding how to create visual feedback interfaces. Building a color picker reinforced the importance of real-time user interaction and visual representation of data.

It's amazing how a simple input element can be transformed into an intuitive color selection tool with just a few lines of JavaScript!
