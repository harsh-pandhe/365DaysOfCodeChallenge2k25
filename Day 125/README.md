# 🎯 Day #125 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I created a **password strength checker** with real-time validation and security scoring! This project was excellent for exploring security concepts, regular expressions, and user interface feedback systems. Building a comprehensive password checker taught me about password security best practices and how to create tools that help users make better security decisions.

The combination of visual feedback, scoring systems, and password generation creates a complete security tool!
