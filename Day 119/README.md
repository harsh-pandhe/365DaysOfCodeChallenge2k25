# 🎯 Day #119 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I built a **weather app using a public API**! This project was incredible for learning about asynchronous JavaScript, API integration, and real-world data fetching. Working with the OpenWeatherMap API taught me how to handle external data sources and create dynamic, data-driven applications.

It's amazing how a few lines of JavaScript can connect your app to real-time global weather data!

## 📚 What I Did Today

* ✅ Integrated OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data  
* ✅ Implemented async/await for clean asynchronous API calls  
* ✅ Created dynamic UI updates based on fetched weather information  
* ✅ Added proper error handling for failed API requests and invalid cities  

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

* ✅ fetch() API enables seamless HTTP requests to external services  
* ✅ async/await syntax makes asynchronous code more readable and maintainable  
* ✅ API keys provide authentication and access control for external services  
* ✅ Error handling with try-catch blocks ensures graceful failure management

## 🚀 Your Turn!

Try extending this weather app with:

* 🧩 Adding 5-day weather forecast display and weather icons  
* ➕ Implementing geolocation to get user's current location weather  
* ⚙️ Creating weather alerts and storing favorite cities in localStorage
