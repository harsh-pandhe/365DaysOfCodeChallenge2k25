# 🎯 Day #121 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I implemented a **dynamic FAQ section using JavaScript**! This project was excellent for learning about interactive UI components, event handling, and CSS state management. Building an accordion-style FAQ section taught me how to create smooth user experiences that help visitors find information quickly and efficiently.

It's amazing how a simple toggle mechanism can make content so much more accessible and user-friendly!

## 📚 What I Did Today

* ✅ Created an accordion-style FAQ section with expandable/collapsible answers  
* ✅ Implemented click event handlers to toggle answer visibility  
* ✅ Added visual indicators (+ and -) to show expand/collapse states  
* ✅ Used CSS classes and JavaScript to manage dynamic state changes

## 💡 Key Learnings

* ✅ Event delegation with forEach allows handling multiple similar elements efficiently  
* ✅ classList.toggle() provides clean state management for interactive components  
* ✅ CSS pseudo-elements (::after) can create dynamic visual indicators  
* ✅ Accordion interfaces improve content organization and user experience

## 🚀 Your Turn!

Try extending this FAQ section with:

* 🧩 Adding smooth CSS transitions for opening/closing animations
