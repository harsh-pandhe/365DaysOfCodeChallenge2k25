## ðŸ’­ **A Personal Reflection:**

Factorials remind me of how small actions can lead to exponential growthâ€”like a single step that sparks a journey. Today, I took on the challenge of calculating factorials, a concept thatâ€™s as elegant in mathematics as it is in programming.

---

## ðŸ“š **What I Did Today:**

I implemented a Python program to calculate the factorial of a number. Factorials are a foundational concept in math and have applications in everything from permutations to probability.

---

### Code:

#### Iterative Approach:
```python
# factorial.py
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "Factorial not defined for negative numbers"
    result = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
print(f"The factorial of {num} is: {factorial(num)}")
```

#### Recursive Approach:
```python
def factorial_recursive(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    return n * factorial_recursive(n - 1)
```

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Learning:**

This task reinforced the importance of iteration and boundary cases. While the iterative method is simple and efficient, itâ€™s fascinating to explore recursive approaches as well.

---

## âœ¨ **Extra Touch:**

I tested the program with different numbers, including edge cases like `0! = 1`. Itâ€™s amazing how such a small program can handle such a significant mathematical operation.

---

## ðŸš€ **Your Turn:**

Try implementing this using recursion or finding factorials for large numbers using libraries like `math.factorial`. Whatâ€™s the largest number youâ€™ve calculated the factorial for?
