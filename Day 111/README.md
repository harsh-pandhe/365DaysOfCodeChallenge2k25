# üéØ Day #111 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## üí≠ Personal Reflection

Today I explored the fascinating world of **network flow problems**, implementing the **Maximum Flow** solution using the **Ford-Fulkerson algorithm** üèûÔ∏è.

It‚Äôs incredible how a simple approach of **finding augmenting paths** and **pushing flow** through a graph can model **real-world systems** ‚Äî from water pipelines and traffic to bipartite matching and logistics networks!

## üìö What I Did Today

* ‚úÖ Built a **flow network** using an adjacency matrix
* ‚úÖ Implemented **Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm** with **DFS** for augmenting path discovery
* ‚úÖ Maintained and updated the **residual graph** to track remaining capacities

## üìù Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm ‚Äì Python Code

```python
def dfs(residual, s, t, visited, path):
    visited[s] = True
    if s == t:
        return True

    for v in range(len(residual)):
        if not visited[v] and residual[s][v] > 0:
            path[v] = s
            if dfs(residual, v, t, visited, path):
                return True
    return False


def ford_fulkerson(graph, source, sink):
    n = len(graph)
    residual = [row[:] for row in graph]
    parent = [-1] * n
    max_flow = 0

    while True:
        visited = [False] * n
        if not dfs(residual, source, sink, visited, parent):
            break

        flow = float("inf")
        v = sink
        while v != source:
            u = parent[v]
            flow = min(flow, residual[u][v])
            v = u

        v = sink
        while v != source:
            u = parent[v]
            residual[u][v] -= flow
            residual[v][u] += flow
            v = u

        max_flow += flow

    return max_flow


graph = [
    [0, 16, 13, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 10, 12, 0, 0],
    [0, 4, 0, 0, 14, 0],
    [0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 20],
    [0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 4],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
]

source = 0
sink = 5
print("Maximum Flow:", ford_fulkerson(graph, source, sink))
```

## üí° Key Learnings

* ‚úÖ **Ford-Fulkerson** is a **greedy augmenting-path algorithm**
* ‚úÖ It leverages a **residual graph** to manage remaining capacities
* ‚úÖ Time Complexity (with DFS): **O(E √ó max\_flow)**
* ‚úÖ More efficient variant: **Edmonds-Karp** (uses BFS ‚Üí O(VE¬≤))
* ‚úÖ Perfect for **transportation, logistics, resource allocation, and matchmaking**
