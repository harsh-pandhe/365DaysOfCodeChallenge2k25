# 🎯 Day #66 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge!  

## 💭 Personal Reflection  
I’ve always been fascinated by how rearranging letters can create so many possibilities. Today’s challenge? **Finding all permutations of a given string!** This problem is a perfect example of recursion and backtracking in action. 🚀  

## 📚 What I Did Today  
I implemented a **recursive function** to generate all possible permutations of a string, making sure to explore every possible arrangement of characters.

### 📝 **String Permutations Implementation**  

```python
def permute(s, chosen=""):
    if len(s) == 0:
        print(chosen)
        return
    
    for i in range(len(s)):
        remaining = s[:i] + s[i+1:]
        permute(remaining, chosen + s[i])

word = "ABC"
permute(word)
```

## 💡 Key Learning  
✅ **How It Works:**  
- We **pick each character**, add it to the current permutation, and **recurse** on the remaining string.  
- When the input string is empty, we **print the permutation**.  

✅ **Time Complexity:**  
- Since there are `n!` (factorial) permutations, this runs in **O(n!) time complexity**.  

✅ **Why It’s Cool?**  
- **Backtracking in action!** 🔥  
- Used in **anagram solvers, password generators, and AI word puzzles** 🧩  
- Essential for **combinatorial problems in CS**

## ✨ Extra Touch  
🔍 **Real-World Applications:**  
- **Cryptography** 🔑 (generating all possible key combinations)  
- **Game Development** 🎮 (word jumble, scrabble AI)  
- **Data Science** 📊 (finding best feature combinations in ML)

## 🚀 Your Turn  
Try running this with different words—how many permutations can you generate? What happens when you use a longer word? 🤔
