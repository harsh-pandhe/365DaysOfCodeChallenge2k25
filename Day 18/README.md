# ðŸŽ¯ Day #18 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge!

## ðŸ’­ **A Personal Reflection:**  
Time is fascinating, especially when it comes to leap years. These extra days keep our calendars aligned with Earthâ€™s orbit. Todayâ€™s task reminded me how even small programming challenges can help us understand the logic behind everyday phenomena.  

---

## ðŸ“š **What I Did Today:**  
I wrote a Python program to determine if a year is a leap year. Leap years occur every 4 years, except for years divisible by 100 but not 400.  

---

### Code:  

```python
# leap_year.py
def is_leap_year(year):
    if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
        return True
    return False

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
if is_leap_year(year):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year! ðŸŒŸ")
else:
    print(f"{year} is not a leap year.")
```

---

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Learning:**  
This task demonstrated how combining simple conditions can solve real-world problems. Itâ€™s also a reminder of how programming makes abstract rules tangible.  

---

## âœ¨ **Extra Touch:**  
I extended the program to calculate the next 5 leap years starting from the given year:  

```python
def next_leap_years(start_year, count=5):
    leap_years = []
    year = start_year
    while len(leap_years) < count:
        if is_leap_year(year):
            leap_years.append(year)
        year += 1
    return leap_years

year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
leap_years = next_leap_years(year)
print(f"The next {len(leap_years)} leap years after {year} are: {leap_years}")
```

---

## ðŸš€ **Your Turn:**  
- Can you extend this program to calculate the number of leap years between two given years?  
- Bonus: Try creating a function that calculates the total number of leap years in a century!
