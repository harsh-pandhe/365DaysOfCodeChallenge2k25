# 🎯 Day #118 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I developed a **stopwatch application** using JavaScript! This project was excellent for understanding time management in programming, working with intervals, and creating precise timing applications. Building a stopwatch taught me about the importance of accurate time calculation and user interface state management.

It's fascinating how JavaScript's Date object and setInterval function can create such precise timing tools!

## 📚 What I Did Today

* ✅ Created a clean stopwatch interface with large time display  
* ✅ Implemented start, stop, and reset functionality with proper state management  
* ✅ Built accurate time formatting for hours, minutes, and seconds display  
* ✅ Used setInterval for continuous time updates and clearInterval for control

## 💡 Key Learnings

* ✅ Date.now() provides precise millisecond timestamps for accurate timing  
* ✅ setInterval and clearInterval manage continuous updates and performance  
* ✅ String padStart() method ensures consistent time formatting display  
* ✅ Button state management prevents multiple timer instances and user confusion

## 🚀 Your Turn!

Try extending this stopwatch with:

* 🧩 Adding lap time functionality to record split times  
* ➕ Implementing millisecond precision display for more accuracy  
* ⚙️ Creating sound notifications and visual alerts for specific time intervals
