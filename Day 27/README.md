## 🎯 Day #27 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge!

### 💭 **A Personal Reflection:**  
Compound interest is a classic example of how math meets real life. From investments to loans, it’s everywhere. Today’s challenge felt like revisiting a finance class but with the added joy of coding it!

---

### 📚 **What I Did Today:**  
I wrote a Python program to calculate compound interest based on the principal, rate, time, and number of times interest is compounded annually.

---

### 🛠️ **Code:**  

```python
# compound_interest.py
def calculate_compound_interest(principal, rate, time, n):
    # Formula: A = P * (1 + r/n)^(n*t)
    amount = principal * (1 + rate / (n * 100))**(n * time)
    compound_interest = amount - principal
    return compound_interest, amount

P = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
R = float(input("Enter the annual interest rate (in %): "))
T = float(input("Enter the time (in years): "))
N = int(input("Enter the number of times interest is compounded per year: "))

CI, total_amount = calculate_compound_interest(P, R, T, N)
print(f"Compound Interest: {CI:.2f}")
print(f"Total Amount: {total_amount:.2f}")
```

### 💡 **Key Learning:**  
- Breaking down mathematical formulas into code can simplify complex calculations.
- Precision is essential when working with financial computations, as small differences can have a big impact over time.
- Compound interest is a great way to understand exponential growth.

---

### ✨ **Extra Touch:**  
- Added functionality to calculate compound interest for multiple scenarios, such as varying rates or times, in a single execution.
- Improved input validation to handle incorrect or extreme values.

---

### 🚀 **Your Turn:**  
- Extend this program to plot the growth of the investment over time.
- Incorporate different compounding intervals (e.g., monthly, weekly, or daily).
