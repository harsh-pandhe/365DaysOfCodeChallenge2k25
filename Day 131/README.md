# 🎯 Day #131 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I developed a **comprehensive theme switcher for light/dark mode** with system preference detection! This project was excellent for learning about CSS custom properties, local storage, and user preference management. Building a theme switcher taught me about modern web accessibility, persistent settings, and creating seamless user experiences that respect system preferences.

The combination of smooth transitions, system integration, and persistent storage creates a truly professional theming system!
