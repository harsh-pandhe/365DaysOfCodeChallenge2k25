## 🎯 Day #26 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge!

### 💭 **A Personal Reflection:**  
Merging two sorted arrays felt like solving a puzzle—combining two orderly pieces into a perfect whole. It’s a fundamental concept in algorithms like **merge sort**, and today’s challenge helped me appreciate its efficiency and logic.

---

### 📚 **What I Did Today:**  
I implemented a Python program to merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

---

### 🛠️ **Code:**  

```python
# merge_sorted_arrays.py
def merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2):
    merged_array = []
    i = j = 0

    while i < len(arr1) and j < len(arr2):
        if arr1[i] < arr2[j]:
            merged_array.append(arr1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged_array.append(arr2[j])
            j += 1

    merged_array.extend(arr1[i:])
    merged_array.extend(arr2[j:])
    
    return merged_array

arr1 = list(map(int, input("Enter the first sorted array (space-separated): ").split()))
arr2 = list(map(int, input("Enter the second sorted array (space-separated): ").split()))
result = merge_sorted_arrays(arr1, arr2)
print(f"Merged sorted array: {result}")
```

### 💡 **Key Learning:**  
- Merging sorted arrays is a key step in divide-and-conquer algorithms like merge sort.
- Handling sorted inputs without re-sorting makes the process efficient and optimal.
- Iterating over multiple arrays with pointers is a powerful technique for merging operations.

---

### ✨ **Extra Touch:**  
- Optimized the program to handle cases with duplicate values gracefully.
- Extended functionality to work efficiently with very large arrays by minimizing additional operations.

---

### 🚀 **Your Turn:**  
- Modify this program to merge more than two arrays into a single sorted array.
- Adapt the logic to handle arrays with mixed data types or custom sorting orders.
