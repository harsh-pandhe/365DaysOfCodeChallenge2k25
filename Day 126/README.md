# 🎯 Day #126 of My 365 Days Coding Challenge

## 💭 Personal Reflection

Today I developed a **currency converter using a public API** with real-time exchange rates! This project was fantastic for learning about API integration, financial data handling, and creating practical tools that solve real-world problems. Building a currency converter taught me about asynchronous programming, data formatting, and user experience in financial applications.

The combination of live exchange rates, intuitive interface, and popular currency shortcuts creates a truly useful financial tool!
